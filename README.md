# Questionares

Pack of questionares. Originally test program "ask.exe" was developed in 2001 on C, then converted to C++ at school on informatics at spare time. It was simple conditional statement checker with hardcoded questions. I release several versions of same questionaries with different question packs, and then add "alignment" test-like questionary.

But only in 2003 this program(s) was improved to use file as database of questions, which make possible to generate unlimited count of questions and edit them independently of the program. This program was eb2004.

Then, several months later, I added windows GUI for it using Borland C++ Builder 5. This program was eb2005. [Link to binaries](http://illusionist7.narod.ru/download/PROGS/eb05.rar)
